      {
        "question": "Why does copy need to be done before design?",
        "answer": "Because copy determines the layout. What visitors need to see first, second, third is a messaging decision that shapes every wireframe. When design comes first, you get layouts filled with placeholder text and headlines that describe features instead of solving problems."
      },
      {
        "question": "What exactly is a 'design system'?",
        "answer": "A reusable set of components, color tokens, typography rules, and spacing conventions that every page inherits. Think of it as a kit of parts your team can assemble into new pages. You get consistency and speed without maintaining either manually, and the site stays on-brand even when you're building pages without us."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a full redesign, or can you improve what I have?",
        "answer": "Depends on the foundation. If your current site has a solid component structure and decent performance, we can optimize within it: layout changes, conversion improvements, new templates. If the codebase is brittle or no design system exists, a strategic rebuild usually pays for itself faster than patching problems individually."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does design connect to SEO and CRO?",
        "answer": "Directly. Page structure affects how Google indexes content and how AI engines parse it. Layout decisions affect where visitors look, what they understand, and whether they act. We design for all three audiences from the first wireframe: human visitors, search crawlers, and AI systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can our team create new pages after launch?",
        "answer": "That's the point of a component system. We train your team on how to assemble pages from the library we build. Landing pages that used to take weeks can ship in hours, consistent and on-brand, without waiting on a designer."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from hiring a design agency?",
        "answer": "Most design agencies deliver mockups. We deliver a working system: components, tokens, documentation, and a site that converts. Design at LoudFace is inseparable from copy, CRO, and SEO. It's not a standalone deliverable. It's the layer where your growth strategy becomes visible."
