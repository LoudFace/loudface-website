    "items": [
      {
        "question": "Why does copy need to come before design?",
        "answer": "Because copy determines page structure. The messaging hierarchy — what visitors need to understand first, second, third — dictates the layout, not the other way around. When design comes first, you get pretty pages with placeholder messaging that doesn't convert. Copy → Design → Dev eliminates that problem."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you write for technical or complex products?",
        "answer": "That's our focus. We work with B2B and SaaS companies where the product is genuinely complex. The process starts with founder interviews and product deep-dives so we can extract the core value, then translate it into language that buyers understand without dumbing down the substance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you use AI to write content?",
        "answer": "We use AI to accelerate research, spot gaps, and pressure-test drafts. But humans write and review everything. AI-generated content has a ceiling — it can't extract founder voice, take a genuine stance, or write with the specificity that builds trust with real buyers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the content production cadence look like?",
        "answer": "For Growth track clients, we typically run 5 new articles plus 5 refreshed articles per week, managed end-to-end. We handle research, content calendars, writing, and publishing. You approve the calendar. We handle the rest."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you work with our existing brand guidelines?",
        "answer": "Yes. We adapt to existing voice and tone guidelines when they exist. When they don't, we create them as part of the positioning work. Either way, every piece of copy sounds like your brand, not like an agency wrote it."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from hiring a freelance copywriter?",
        "answer": "A freelancer writes words. We design how information lives on your site — what goes where, why, and how it connects to search, conversion, and your broader growth program. Copy isn't a silo here. It's the foundation everything else is built on."
